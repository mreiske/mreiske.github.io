Hello, welcome to my website!

<img align="right" src="./assets/images/IMG_3938.jpeg" alt="IMG_3938" width="150" height="210" >

I am currently a PhD-Candidate at the Berlin School of Economics - Humboldt University Berlin - under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nikolauswolf01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Nikolaus Wolf</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection of quantitative economic history and political economy, with a particular focus on the rise of political extremism in 20th-century Germany. 
In my dissertation, I investigate how economic deprivation and party strategies, such as targeted repressive violence, contributed to the rise of the Nazi party before 1933.

#### Losing the country: Debt, deflation, and the rural rise of the Nazi party (with Thilo Albers and Felix Kersting) 
<details><summary>DRAFT COMING SOON: Abstract</summary>
    <p align="justify">Using interwar German agriculture as a case, this paper explores the economic and political cost of debt deflation. We first characterize the change in farmers' leverage by employing a decomposition, documenting systematic differences of its drivers between the period of debt accumulation (1924-1928) and the period of debt deflation (1929-1932).  We construct exogenous exposure measures to debt uptake and deflation for the two respective periods, which allow us to  elicit their impact on economic destitution and voting. While rapid debt accumulation triggered discontent,  the Nazi party was only able to unify the rural protest vote in the 1930s. We show that the exposure to debt deflation can explain both the cross-sectional variation as well as the NSDAP's higher vote share among the rural vis-à-vis the urban electorate. In light of the failed economic policy attempts of centrist parties before the Nazis' ascension to power, we posit that the only viable solution to the debt deflation problem would have been a devaluation of the currency. </p>

#### Effects of political violence: The Nazis' "Fight for Berlin"
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p align="justify">Under which circumstances can a violent movement succeed in attracting new members and quelling opposition and when does it create backlash? To address these questions, I examine the Nazis’ “Fight for Berlin” between 1928 and 1933. Particularly in the capital city, establishing control over opposition strongholds was a central strategic objective for the Nazi party to suppress protest in case of its ascension to power. For this purpose, the stormtroopers - the NSDAP’s fighting force and under its directive - initiated a sustained campaign of establishing permanent operational bases in predominantly Communist areas. These so-called ‘Sturmlokale’ served as launching points for confrontations with the political enemy and thus introduced a sustained increase of violence into the respective neighborhoods. 

In this article, I proceed in three steps: First, I show how the stormtroopers successfully expanded into opposition strongholds between 1928 and 1932 and how they strategically positioned themselves closely to Communist meeting places and police stations. Second, I show that increased Nazi presence did in fact lead to more violent incidents in surrounding areas. Third, I investigate the effects of Nazi presence on subsequent election results and explore potential heterogeneity along local Communist strength and police activity. 

To pinpoint the exact place and timing of stormtrooper presence, I build on previous historical research by cross-referencing information extracted from NS sources with police archives. Similarly, I build detailed point data on Communist meeting places and police stations. Combined with an original data set of Weimar-era election results on the precinct level and equally granular economic information, such as floor prices, this allows me to trace the strategic interactions of the three relevant groups. For identification, I additionally exploit the fact that the stormtroopers chose the locations of their operational bases with a preference for pubs situated on street corners to ensure visibility and readiness for potential confrontations. This allows me to construct a measure of expected exposure to political violence on the precinct level to gauge the causal impact of actual exposure. 

With this paper, I contribute to the literature on the role of party strategy in the rise of the NSDAP by focusing specifically on the violence of the movement where previous research has analyzed its propaganda measures, such as Adena et al. (2015) and Caesmann et al. (2021). I also add to the literature on social movements and protests more generally by investigating the interaction of two political competitors that both oppose the state. </p>
